I am now a M.Sc. student at [Technological Federal University - Paraná](https://www.utfpr.edu.br/cursos/programas-de-pos-graduacao/ppgee-cp) (UTFPR), advised by Prof. Dr. [Paulo Rogério Scalassara](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7169-954X). I am curently working on feature selection and interpretability techniques (e.g., SHAP) to understand the features' importance in voice disorder classification. Previously, I have worked on optimization methods for selecting the best hyperparameters in classification models, and I have explored deep learning methods for multiple voice disorder classification.

I received my bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering at [Technological Federal University - Paraná](https://www.utfpr.edu.br/cursos/programas-de-pos-graduacao/ppgee-cp) in 2023. During my bachelor's degree, I had the opportunity to work on speech analysis and automatic voice disorder identification with Prof. Dr. [María Eugenia Dajer](http://paginapessoal.utfpr.edu.br/medajer/maria-eugenia-dajer).

I have a broad interest in applying machine learning and signal processing to drive transformative change, whether in speech analysis, healthcare, or any field where innovative technology can make a meaningful impact on the world.

I am eager to contribute to cutting-edge research and bring my expertise in both practical applications and theoretical foundations to a PhD program.
