  abstract={This study focus in the detection of Reinke’s edema based on vowel recordings. This benign disorder is characterized as edematous changes on the vocal folds, altering the produced voice. In order to assist in the diagnosis, we analyzed the effectiveness of Wavelet-Packet decomposition with different families (Haar and Daubechies) up to the seventh level of sustained vowel signals and compared the performance of support vector machine and multilayer perceptron classifiers to identify this disorder. One of the contributions of this work is to provide a filter method for selecting attributes from the Wavelet decomposition leaves. We show that less than 50% of the leaves are relevant for classification, but the ones from the initial, central, and final portions of the decomposition proved to be important, indicating that components from all frequency ranges help in the detection of Reinke’s edema. The Daubechies db5 family showed the highest overall accuracy in the tests, and the db2 family proved to be more consistent. It can be seen that the support vector machine, in addition to performing comparably to the multilayer perceptron, stands out for its significantly shorter training times, contributing to the practical viability of this approach in diagnosing Reinke’s edema.}

    abstract = {The article presents a comparative analysis of four approaches to optimizing the hyperparameters of MLPs in the classification
of Reinke's edema. The study compared a traditional metaheuristic method, PSO, and a recent one, WOA. The work's
highlight came in the BPSO algorithm's performance, particularly when applied with the transfer function in S. This method
achieved rapid convergence and superior results, contrasting with the rapid saturation in local maximum observed in BWOA. A
comparison with random attribute selection revealed that although this approach found solutions with higher values, its random
nature prevented convergence and local exploration, which are crucial characteristics in metaheuristic algorithms. The study
concludes that BPSO with an S-shaped transfer function significantly improves the performance of MLPs in classifying
Reinke's edema from speech samples with a sustained vowel. Future work is suggested to explore other optimization
algorithms and validate these approaches on different data sets, covering classification and regression problems.}
